# MCBlockCodingTranslationProject
A repository for resource packs dedicated to making the Minecraft Education Block Coding courses more open to all.


## How To

Open the file in MC Edu and load the resource pack in the main menu (Settings> Global Resources> My Packs> Activate). Only load individual packs before going on that course. Don't load multiple packs at once or the incorrect pack for the wrong course. This will lead to conflict. Might still work though, just not well.

## FAQ

### The block coding hints aren't translated, why is that?
Unfortunately translating the hints in the editor is impossible without significantly more effort. It involves redoing the worlds from the ground up, since the block coding is actually done on a website and I'd need to clone it for it to be modifiable
